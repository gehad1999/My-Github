Details about  implementations:
* includes arm with its four fingers ,each object with the applicable range of rotation .
* the shoulder rotates about origin ,the implementation observes the ability of each object in the robotic arm to rotate with how much angle .
* the abduction range in rotation differs from the compression range in rotation for each element in the robotic arm .
   
Issues I faced in the assignment:
* difficulties in specifying the directions in the space to be edited for moving elements (like fingers) to the position that i need locate it in.
* In testing the rotation to be about the same point.
* when i should use push and pop to make the desired rotation on only the wanted element.
* for each rotation to be obsereved i should make a button for it to control its rotation and its angle of rotation .

How I treated with issues:
* Mostly of them treated experimently to see the result which would refer to the unknown information.
* the problem of make part of code not to be seen for the rest of lines of code which is soled using push and pop instructions were from asking one of my classmates.

Sample results of my code:
* The elbow is rotated here with fingers in its direction of rotation but not all the shoulder rotates in this picture .

* In the next picture the rotation of each finger is happend when clicked on each button from keyboard to rotate each one separately without rotation of any other element that is can be effected by its rotation and i activates the rotation of elbow .

* In Next photo , it is observed some of lines in my code editition .
