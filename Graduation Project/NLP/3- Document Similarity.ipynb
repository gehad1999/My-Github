Based on all available evidence and complaint investigations of a similar nature, an investigation determined that the reported complaint was due to an isolated component failure within the device main circuit board (pcba). Resmeds risk analysis for this failure mode concludes that the risk is acceptable. Resmed reference #: (b)(4). Report late due to transition from vmsr program. Establishment was unaware of fda letter dated 16 september 2019 for cbk procode status change in vmsr program until notified directly by fda on 18 december 2019 following submission of our quarterly summary report.', 'Complainant alleged that during a routine shift check by a clinician, the device would not power up. Complainant indicated that there was no patient involvement in the reported malfunction.The device was returned to zoll medical corporation; the customers report was duplicated and attributed to a faulty capacitor on the smart pneumatic module board.
